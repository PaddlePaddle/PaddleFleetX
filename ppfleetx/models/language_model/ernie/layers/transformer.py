        3. If `type` is `Cache` and `value` is not None, use `key`, `value` to create

class TransformerEncoderLayer(Layer):
    """
    TransformerEncoderLayer is composed of two sub-layers which are self (multi-head)
    attention and feedforward network. Before and after each sub-layer, pre-process
    and post-precess would be applied on the input and output accordingly. If
    `normalize_before` is True, pre-process is layer normalization and post-precess
    includes dropout, residual connection. Otherwise, no pre-process and post-precess
    includes dropout, residual connection, layer normalization.

    Parameters:
        d_model (int): The expected feature size in the input and output.
        nhead (int): The number of heads in multi-head attention(MHA).
        dim_feedforward (int): The hidden layer size in the feedforward network(FFN).
        dropout (float, optional): The dropout probability used in pre-process
            and post-precess of MHA and FFN sub-layer. Default 0.1
        activation (str, optional): The activation function in the feedforward
            network. Default relu.
        attn_dropout (float, optional): The dropout probability used
            in MHA to drop some attention target. If None, use the value of
            `dropout`. Default None
        act_dropout (float, optional): The dropout probability used after FFN
            activition.  If None, use the value of `dropout`. Default None
        normalize_before (bool, optional): Indicate whether to put layer normalization
            into preprocessing of MHA and FFN sub-layers. If True, pre-process is layer
            normalization and post-precess includes dropout, residual connection.
            Otherwise, no pre-process and post-precess includes dropout, residual
            connection, layer normalization. Default False
        weight_attr(ParamAttr|list|tuple, optional): To specify the weight parameter property.
            If it is a list/tuple, `weight_attr[0]` would be used as `weight_attr` for
            MHA, and `weight_attr[1]` would be used as `weight_attr` for linear in FFN.
            Otherwise, MHA and FFN both use it as `weight_attr` to create parameters.
            Default: None, which means the default weight parameter property is used.
            See usage for details in :code:`ParamAttr` .
        bias_attr (ParamAttr|list|tuple|bool, optional): To specify the bias parameter property.
            If it is a list/tuple, `bias_attr[0]` would be used as `bias_attr` for
            MHA, and `bias_attr[1]` would be used as `bias_attr` for linear in FFN.
            Otherwise, MHA and FFN both use it as `bias_attr` to create parameters.
            The `False` value means the corresponding layer would not have trainable
            bias parameter. See usage for details in :code:`ParamAttr` . Default: None,
            which means the default bias parameter property is used.
